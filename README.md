## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Screenshot
<!-- 
![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above. -->

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
    I began buy thoroughly inspecting the design plans, and figuring out how to markup my html in boxes. Afterwards I went ahead and completed the basic designs of the website starting with the initial desktop appearance(before anything is clicked on). Followed by the initial mobile appearance. 

    After completing the base SCSS for them, I will now be moving on to completing the individual components for when things get clicked on, in this phase is where I will start to use JavaScript to control the state of the website to allow or disable different functionality.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop First-Workflow
- Responsive Design


### What I learned

In this project I learned to make efficient use of my time. The big improvement I wanted to make is in my workflow with just basic html, css, and javascript. I am a strong believer in mastering the basics, and even once you have moved on, you should never be afraid to move backwards a step or two and resolidify your knowledge.


### Continued development checklist
-User should be able to cycle through thumbnails both on desktop and mobile
-User should be able to add item to cart
-User should be able to view cart
